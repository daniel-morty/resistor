INSTRUCTIONS:
==================================================================================================
- compile using gcc or g++
	gcc main.cpp -o [insert name here]
- the name I usually use is resistor.
	
- there are two run modes
	- to run type the name used during compiling, then the colors on the resistor
		eg. resistor red red brown
		-the program will return the value of the resistor in ohms
	-the other mode the user may type in a value like this
		resistor 220
		- the program will return the color code of a resistor of that value (if one is known)
